# Enigma
A virtual version of the enigma machine with the same rotors, reflectors and mechanics as the real thing.

Custom reflectors and rotors can be added via the reflectors.txt rotors.txt files respectively. FORMATTING MUST BE KEPT THE SAME OR IT WILL RESULT IN ERRORS.

Plugboard settings should be entered as the two letters you want to connect consecutively followed by a space eg. 'AB CD EF'. letters must be uppercase and no other characters beside spaces should be added.

Enjoy!
